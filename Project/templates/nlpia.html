<h1>qary</h1>
<p>
The `qary` package is both a chatbot framework and a working "reference implementation" virtual assistant that actually assists! Most bots manipulate you to make money for their corporate masters. Your bot can help protect you and amplify your intelligence.

The presentations for San Diego Python User Group are at <a href="http://totalgood.org/midata/talks/">http://totalgood.org/midata/talks/</a> and in `docs/`.
</p>

<h1>Skills</h1>
<p>
The `-b glossary` skill enables `qary` to answer basic "what is" questions about data science for healthcare terms and concepts.
</p>
<h1>bot -b QA</h1>
<p>
It can even answer general factual questions like "What is Barak Obama's Birthday?".
But if the answer isn't explicitly stated on Wikipedia somewhere it will make something up:

<ul>
    <li>YOU: When was Barak Obama born?
</li>
     <li>qary: August 4, 1961
</li>
      <li>YOU: Who invented the perceptron?
</li>
       <li>qary: Everett Rogers
</li>
        <li>YOU: -1 #shouldbe Frank Rosenblatt
</li>
         <li>YOU: Who invented the first perceptron neural network?
</li>
          <li>qary: Gustav Kirchhoff
</li>
           <li>YOU: -1 #shouldbe Frank Rosenblatt
</li>
            <li>YOU: Where do babies come from?
</li>
             <li>qary: industrialized countries
</li>
              <li>YOU: #goodone
</li>

</ul>
</p>


<h1>Others</h1>
<p>
The current version of `qary` can imitate the classic therapist bot "Eliza" and carry on a relatively entertaining conversation based on lines it's read from movie scripts.
You can select any or all of these skills with command line args and the configuration file `~/qary.ini` in your user directory.

You can also expand the complicated questions that qary can answer by adding Q/A pairs to yaml text files in  `data/faq`.
We'll use that to train deep learning networks as well as actual answers if the questions are close enough to your wording in that training file.
</p>


<h1>bot -b your_name_here</h1>
<p>
And soon `qary` will be able to detect your mood and carry on more meaningful conversations, to give you encouragement and emotional support.
We'll have something like this online in a couple months:

<ul>
    <li>bot: How are you doing?
</li>
    <li>YOU: not so great
</li>
    <li>bot: I'm really sorry to hear that. What do you think about doing 10 pushups to get your blood flowing?
</li>
    <li>YOU: not so much
</li>
    <li>bot: Would you like to chat about it?
</li>
    <li>YOU: sure
</li>
    <li>bot: So what are you feeling right now? How does your body feel?
</li>

</ul>
</p>

<h1>Install</h1>
<p>
You'll want to install and use the conda package manager within Anaconda3, especially if your development environment is not an open standard operating system like Linux.

<br />
git clone git@gitlab.com:tangibleai/qary
<br />
cd qary
<br />
conda env create -n qaryenv -f environment.yml  # or environment-windoze.yml
<br />
conda activate qaryenv
<br />
pip install --editable .

</p>
<h1>Usage</h1>
<p>
```bash
$ bot --help
<br />
usage: bot [-h] [--version] [--name STR] [-p] [-b STR] [-v] [-vv] [words [words ...]]
<br />

You can run bot just like any other command line app, giving it your statement/query as an argument.

<br />
$ bot what is an allele
bot: A variant form of a given gene, a version of a known mutation at the same place as the original unmodified gene within a chromosome.
<br />

Travis's probabilistic conversation manager is working nicely to chose a reply from the possiblities generated by the bots:
<br />
<ol>
    <li>qa_bots.py`: BERT and ALBERT Wikipedia Question Answering (WikiQA reading comprehension tests)</li>
    <li>pattern_bots.py`: regex patterns and greeting templates</li>
<li>fuzzy_search_bots.py`: movie dialog fuzzy matching</li>
<li>parul_bots.py`: Wikipedia searches using conventional TFIDFs, like a search engine</li>
<li>eliza_bots.py`: A python port of the ELIZA therapist bot</li>
<li>time_bots.py`: A time and productivity tracker that parses your git logs and bash history</li>
<li>elastic_bots.py`: Semantic search with elasticsearch and `nboost` to find better pages for WikiQA</li>

</ol>

Here's how those bots work together:
<br />

$ bot
<br />
(nlpia) hobs@Hobsons-MacBook-Air:~/code/chatbot/qary$ bot
<br />
# 2019-11-21 12:59:05,854 WARNING:nlpia.constants:107:            Starting logger in nlpia.constants...

<br />
YOU: Hi
<br />
BOT: hey there. tired of breathing?
<br />
YOU: Hello
<br />
BOT: How do you do. Please state your problem.
<br />
YOU: What is an ELIZA chatbot?
<br />
BOT: joey never told you we went out, did he?
<br />
YOU: ^[[A
<br />
BOT: I am sorry! I dont understand you
<br />
YOU: What is an ELIZA chatbot?
<br />
BOT: Does that question interest you ?
<br />
YOU: What is a chatbot?
<br />
BOT: hello barbie is an internet-connected version of the doll that uses a <br />
chatbot provided by the company toytalk, which previously used the chatbot <br />
for a range of smartphone-based characters for children.
<br />
YOU: Hello
<br />
BOT: hello.
<br />YOU: Hello
<br />
BOT: How do you do. Please state your problem.
<br />
YOU: bye


Check out the config file in `qary.ini` or `$ bot -h` to change the default bot personalities loaded for your own personalized bot.

<h1>Crazy Ideas</h1>
<p>
Please submit your feature ideas [GitLab issues](https://gitlab.com/tangibleai/qary/issues/). Here are a few ideas to get you started.

1. movie dialog in django database to hold the statement->response pairs
    1. graph schema compatible with MxGraph (draw.io) and other js libraries for editing graphs/flow   charts.
    2. ubuntu dialog corpus in db
    3. mindfulness faq corpus in db
    4. famous quotes as responses to the statement "tell me something inspiring"
    5. jokes for "tell me a joke"
    6. data science faq
    7. nlpia faq
    8. psychology/self-help faq
2. html django template so there is a web interface to the app rather than just the command line command `bot`
3. use Django Rest Framework to create a basic API that returns json containing a reply to any request sent to the local host url, like `http://localhost:8000/api?statement='Hello world'` might return {'reply': 'Hello human!'}
4. have the command line app use the REST API from #3 rather than the slow reloading of the csv file every time you talk to the bot
5. use database full text search to find appropriate statements in the database that we have a response for
6. use semantic search instead of text similarity (full text search or fuzzywyzzy text matches)
    1. add embedding vectors (300D document vectors from spacy) to each statement and response in the db
    2. create a semantic index of the document vectors using `annoy` so "approximate nearest neighbors" (semantic matches) can be found quickly
    3. load the annoy index of the document vectors every time the server is started and use it to find the best reply in the database.
    4. use universal sentence encodings instead of docvecs from spacy.
7. create a UX for dialog graph creation/design:
    1. install [mxgraph](https://github.com/totalgood/mxgraph) in the django app
    2. create a basic page based on this mxgraph example so the user can build and save dialog to the db as a graph: [tutorial](https://jgraph.github.io/mxgraph/docs/tutorial.html#1), [example app](https://jgraph.github.io/mxgraph/javascript/examples/grapheditor/www/index.html)
    3. convert the dialog graph into a set of records/rows in the qary db so it acts
8. tag different dialog graphs in the db so the user can turn them on/off for their bot
    1. allow the user to prioritize some dialogs/models over others
    2. allow the user to create their own weighting function to prioritize individual statements produced by the api
9. train a character-based generative model
    1. decoder half of autoencoder to generate text based on docvecs from spacy
    2. decoder part of autoencoder to generate text based on universal sentence encodings
    3. train model to generate reply embeddings (doc vecs and/or use vecs) using statement embeddings (dialog engine encoder-decoder using docvecs or use vecs for the encoder half
10. add a therapy/mindfulness-coach feature to respond with mindfulness ideas to some queries/statements
11. add the "translate 'this text' to spanish" feature
    1. train character-based LSTM models on english-spanish, english-french, english-german, english<->whatever
    2. add module for this to the django app/api
12. AIML engine fallback
